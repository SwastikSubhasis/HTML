    <h3><u>ABOUT ME</u></h3>
    <p>My passion is for marketing and technology and how I aim to merge these two fields in my career. As a
        4th-year computer science student, I've cultivated a strong foundation in technology, and my curiosity
        for the ever-evolving digital landscape has led me to explore the intersection of marketing and
        technology with great enthusiasm. What sets me apart is my genuine passion for marketing. I've
        proactively sought opportunities to apply my technical skills to real-world marketing challenges. I've
        collaborated on projects that involve data-driven marketing strategies, conducted market research, and
        leveraged emerging technologies to optimize marketing campaigns. This hands-on experience has
        allowed me to grasp the intricacies of marketing and technology integration.</p>
